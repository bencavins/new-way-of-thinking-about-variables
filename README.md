# A New Way to Think About Variables
Many people think about variables as buckets at "contain" data. We can also think about variables as names that "point" to data that exists somewhere else.

## Define Mutability
- Mutable: We can change the data
- Immutable: We _cannot_ change the data

## Immutable Types in Javascript
Primitive data types are all immutable:
- number
- string
- boolean

## Mutable Types in Javascript
- array
- object
